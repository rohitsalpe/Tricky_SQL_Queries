** Delete & truncate:
 -- Delete needs commit while truncate does not.
 -- Truncate is faster than delete.
 -- We can delete from 2 tables at the same time

 ** Char datatype stores the data and pads spaces in left over spaces
 ** Varchar2 stores only the data.
 ** Bool datatype table cannot be created.

 ** Substr - Used to extract a substring from a string
 ** Instr - Used to return the location of a substring in a string

 ** LPAD & RPAD are used to add padding characters to the left or right side of a string up to a given length

 ** Different Date functions:
    Months_Between
    Last_Day
    Next_Day
    Add_Months
    Extract

** Difference between Decode and Case: (Both provide IF THEN ELSE functionality)
   Decode is a simple switch comparing each argument against the first such..
   Where as CASE allows you to do different tests with each WHEN clause.

 **Any arithmatic function done with null result "NULL"
 NVL is used to replace null values with default value
 NVL2 accpets 3 parameters, if not null returns 2nd value and if null returns 3rd value
 NUll IF - if both the values are null then returns null & if both values same then returns 1st value

 COALESCE : it accepts two to more parameters and returns the first non null value.

 ** When you create a primary key, by default a unique index is created.

 ** On Delete Cascade:
    A foreign key with cascade delete means that if a record in the parent table is
    deleted then the corresponding records in the child table will automatically be deleted.

Set operators:
Union - returns all the unique rows
Union all - returns all the rows including duplicates (Union all is faster than Union)
Minus - Rows that are unique for the first query will be retrieved
Intersect - common rows from both the queries will be retrieved.

** Subquery that appears in FROM clause is called Inline View
