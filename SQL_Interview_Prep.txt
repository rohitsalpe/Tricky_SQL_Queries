** Delete & truncate:
 -- Delete needs commit while truncate does not.
 -- Truncate is faster than delete.
 -- We can delete from 2 tables at the same time

 ** Char datatype stores the data and pads spaces in left over spaces
 ** Varchar2 stores only the data.
 ** Bool datatype table cannot be created.

 ** Substr - Used to extract a substring from a string
 ** Instr - Used to return the location of a substring in a string

 ** LPAD & RPAD are used to add padding characters to the left or right side of a string up to a given length

 ** Different Date functions:
    Months_Between
    Last_Day
    Next_Day
    Add_Months
    Extract

** Difference between Decode and Case: (Both provide IF THEN ELSE functionality)
   Decode is a simple switch comparing each argument against the first such..
   Where as CASE allows you to do different tests with each WHEN clause.

 **Any arithmatic function done with null result "NULL"
 NVL is used to replace null values with default value
 NVL2 accpets 3 parameters, if not null returns 2nd value and if null returns 3rd value
 NUll IF - if both the values are null then returns null & if both values same then returns 1st value

 COALESCE : it accepts two to more parameters and returns the first non null value.

 ** When you create a primary key, by default a unique index is created.

 ** On Delete Cascade:
    A foreign key with cascade delete means that if a record in the parent table is
    deleted then the corresponding records in the child table will automatically be deleted.

Set operators:
Union - returns all the unique rows
Union all - returns all the rows including duplicates (Union all is faster than Union)
Minus - Rows that are unique for the first query will be retrieved
Intersect - common rows from both the queries will be retrieved.

** Subquery that appears in FROM clause is called Inline View

** We can create index, primary key, partitions  on virtual columns and
   we cannot update data in virtual columns

** Nested loop joins:
   Driving row source is small and the joined columns of the inner row source are
   uniquely indexed.
   Typically for OLTP queries

**Different Hints:
  Index hints
  Parallel hints

** AWR(Automatic Workload Repository) is a built in repository in the Oracle DB
   At regular intervals Oracle DB makes a snapshot of all of its vital statistics
   and workload information and stores in the AWR.

** TKPROF : Oracle DB utility used to format SQL trace output into human readable format
   $ tkprof oracl102_ora_30987.trc output.prf EXPLAIN=scott/tiger SYS=NO

** Various reasons an index can be suppressed:
   - Using functions on an index columns
   - performing arithmetic operations on index column
   - Use of <> on an index column
   - Use of concatenation operator || on an index column
   - Comparing a character indexed column with a numeric value
   - Use of IS NULL or IS NOT NULL

** MV's:
   Refresh types:
     FAST
     COMPLETE
     FORCE
  Refresh Methods:
     ON COMMIT
     ON DEMAND - most commonly used

** Difference between View and MV:
  - A views sql is executed at run time, while for mv the output is stored in db and the
    query only browses the result.
  - View occupies no space, while MV needs space.
  - Views data is on the fly, real time data whereas MV data is not real time
  - Hide implementation for complex query from user, use View, and when we want to build aggregate
    tables from entire data use MV's.

** PIVOT() : Converts row level data to column level using PIVOT
** UNPIVOT(): Converts column level data to row level data

** LISTAGG(): This function concatenates values of the row level columns for each GROUP based
   on the ORDER BY clause

** LAG() & LEAD(): Gives access to multiple rows within a table, without the need for a self join
   LAG(): This function is used to access data from a previous row.
   LEAD(): This function is used to return data from the next row.

** In Rank() the sequence of the rank is not consecutive if 2 records are same but in Dense_Rank()
   the sequence of the rank is consecutive.

**LOB:
  Internal LOB:
   - CLOB
   - NCLOB
   - BLOB
  External LOB:
   - BFILE
